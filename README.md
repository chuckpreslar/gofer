## About

You see too many Go packages relying on rake.  Why should we force people to use something that's not native to the platform they're developing for?  __gofer__ was made for just this reason.

As long as you place your task files within a `tasks` directory, and import the __gofer__ package, users will have access to them from anywhere as long as the binary is installed along their `PATH` environment variable.

## Installation

    $ go get -u github.com/chuckpreslar/gofer/gofer

## Usage

The following is the most basic example:

```go
//  $GOPATH/
//    src/
//      your_package/
//        tasks/
//          task_one.go

package tasks

import (
  "github.com/chuckpreslar/gofer"
)

var TaskOne = gofer.Register(gofer.Task{
  Label:       "task_one",
  Description: "Performs a simple task.",
  Action: func() error {
    // Perform something when called.
  },
})
```

To access the task you created, simply execute the following command from your terminal:

    $ gofer task_one

Yes, yes.. of course you can namespace (or sectionalize) your tasks:

```go
var TaskOne = gofer.Register(gofer.Task{
  Section:     "my_package:sub_section",
  Label:       "task_one",
  Description: "Performs a simple task.",
  Action: func() error {
    // Perform something when called.
  },
})

// $ gofer my_package:sub_section:task_one
```

Don't worry about the chicken or the egg problem; if you somehow manage to create a nested task before its parent, __gofer__ simply carves out a blank space for you to come back and potentially fill in later.

You can also give your tasks dependencies that will be evaluated in the appropriate order:

```go
var TaskTwo = gofer.Register(gofer.Task{
  Section:     "my_package",
  Label:       "task_two",
  Dependencies: []string{"my_package:task_one"},
  Description: "Performs a simple task after my_package:task_one executes.",
  Action: func() error {
    // Perform something when called.
  },
})

// $ gofer my_package:task_two # executes my_package:task_one followed by my_package:task_two
```

More complex dependency mapping is also resolved as long as there are no cyclic dependencies.

## Note

This is simply a proposal of how I feel a Go task manage should work.  If you feel you have a feature that should be added or that code is sloppy in an area, please, open a pull request for discussion.
